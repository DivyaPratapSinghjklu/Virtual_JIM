# Virtual JIM - Posture Detection

Virtual JIM is a computer vision project that utilizes the `mediapipe` library to detect and analyze posture while performing exercises. It focuses on providing feedback only when the detected posture is close to correct, enhancing the user's exercise experience.

## Features

- **Posture Detection:**
  - Utilizes `mediapipe` for accurate posture detection.
  - Monitors and analyzes user posture during various exercises (cuurrently for deadlifts and pushups).

- **DISPLAY:**
  - Provides feedback and counts thhe reps  only when the detected posture is close to correct.
  - Enhances the user's exercise experience with targeted feedback.

 - **FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:**
   -building more models for various variations of isometric and compound exercises.
   -implement better DL or ML models for proper classification of movment.   



### Depedencies
